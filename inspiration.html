          <p>MS Dhoni is my Inspiration. Many people take him as a role model because he hits big sixes or he hits many kinds of shots, but I considered him as my role model because of his "Decision taking ability", Now what is this decision taking ability? I will give you an example, when Rohit Sharma goes for batting in the lower order, that time he did not play well at all, that time Dhoni told him to go at opening order, from that day he has given an outstanding perfomance, thanks to Dhoni. This is why I took him as a role model.</p>
